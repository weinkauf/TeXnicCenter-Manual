Introduction
============

What is TeXnicCenter?
---------------------

TeXnicCenter is an integrated development environment (IDE) used to create, edit
and compile LaTeX documents on Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7.  It
includes a code editor with syntax highlighting and provides document structure
visualization.

The compilation process that converts LaTeX documents into a typeset output can
be started by simply choosing a menu item or clicking a toolbar button. LaTeX
compiler diagnostics are displayed in a separate window allowing to navigate
through the errors, warnings and bad box messages.

A viewer that displays the typeset document can be started using a single click.
Viewers that support TeXnicCenter's *forward/inverse search* can be used to
switch between the typeset document and the corresponding line in the source.

TeXnicCenter's aim is to support unexperienced LaTeX users by providing
shortcuts to important LaTeX commands via menu entries.  Furthermore, the
execution of the LaTeX compiler and tools such as MakeIndex and BibTeX is
handled automatically.  TeXnicCenter supports advanced LaTeX users as well by
providing a powerful, fully customizable integrated development environment.

Requirements
------------

To typeset LaTeX documents, TeXnicCenter requires a LaTeX distribution to be
installed. Major LaTeX distributions supported by TeXnicCetner are `MiKTeX
<http://miktex.org/>`_ and `TeX Live
<http://www.tug.org/texlive/windows.html>`_. To view typeset PDF documents, a
PDF viewer should be installed as well. The recommended PDF viewer  is `Sumatra
PDF <http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf>`_ which provides an
excellent forward/inverse search support.
